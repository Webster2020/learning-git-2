    <h1 class="title">Trees</h1>
    <h3 class="subtitle">by Joyce Kilmer</h3>
    <p>I think that I shall never see<br>
      A poem lovely as a tree<br><br>
      A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br>
      Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;<br><br>
      A tree that looks at God all day,<br>
      And lifts her leafy arms to pray;<br><br>
      A tree that may in Summer wear<br>
      A nest of robins in her hair;<br><br>
      Upon whose bosom snow has lain;<br>
      Who intimately lives with rain.<br><br>
      Poems are made by fools like me,<br>
      But only God can make a tree.
